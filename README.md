# Electron Density Integration Tools

A suite of tools that read `.cub` files and integrates electron density data (see [Python](Python)). Also includes convenience scripts for batching many instances of a script on the UIUC Campus Cluster (see [Bash](Bash)). There are also a handful of graphing scripts for visualizing this data (in [Python](Python)).

There is also a script that generates [example](Example) data with instructions on how to use these tools on that data.
