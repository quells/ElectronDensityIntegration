# Electron Density Integration Tools

A suite of tools that read `.cub` files and integrates electron density data (see [Python](tree/master/Python)). Also includes convenience scripts for batching many instances of a script on the UIUC Campus Cluster (see [Bash](tree/master/Bash)). There are also a handful of graphing scripts for visualizing this data (in [Python](tree/master/Python)).
